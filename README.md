ShadeBot is a discord bot primarily made for the Hentai! server Discord! It's function is to welcome people using a special welcome room. When users join the server, they can only see #announcements #rules and #go-here-for-user-rank and they need to have a profile picture &  type a specific password. In our case it's simply **Hi**. They will then be welcomed in the primary chat room.

Shadebot has a small Gambling system in it. Each day a user can come in and do ``#daily`` and can get **100 Shadebucks** which can be used towards roulette and a luckydip game which can let them gain more Shadebucks!

The bot  handles our events team points, allowing users to cash out for items such as Steam Credit, or Custom Roles / Commands.

As on many servers you have a few roles which users can "self assign". With Shadebot, there's a specific room which users can ask for a role and be provided with them.

"But I only want specific people, who have X role to gain this role", ShadeBot can do that!

Shadebot has a muting system that will add a specific role to a user to mute them and then will remove it at specific time. (Work in progress)

There's a few other things that Shadebot can do.
**Currently Shadebot is made more for the Hentai server, however in the future a config file will be made to make it more open source for other servers to use!**
